Relational:-
-> In RDB, data is stored in tabuler form with rows & column.
-> It is Vertically scalable.
-> It is Table base database.
-> RDB is SQL(structured query language) for defining & manipulating the data.
-> RDB emphasizes on ACID properties(Autonicity, Consistency, isolation & Durability).
-> Ex: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.
-> Use cases: Complex software solution, eCommerce, financial application.

Non-Relational:-
-> In NonRDB is a type of database, that does not store data in tabuler form,
   Insted this type of DB uses a hierarchical structure to store data.
-> It is Horizontally scalable.
-> It is Document base database like, Key-value pairs, graph database, wide-column.
-> NRDB uses unstructured query language, depending on data model.
-> NRB follows Brewers CAP theorem(Consistency, Availability, & partition tolerance).
-> Ex: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis.
-> Use cases: Storing & scalling unstructured data, MVPs for strtups, 
   sprint-based Agile development.
